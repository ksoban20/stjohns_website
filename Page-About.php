			<div class="content">Saint Johns Academy is indeed fortunate to have an environment which is very conductive to learning. The college have all infrastructure and amenities required for the over all development of all the children which make them stand class apart from others.  Bringing perfection in a child depends upon how he or she moulded. We focus on competencies of self learning.Emotional intelligence and positive attributes of learners through concepts like appreciation of nature Aesthetic's sensibility, dignity of labour, mental andsocial hygiene. The sincerity diligence of the staff of St. Johns and their endeavors to provide value based competitive quality education has made all the difference as there is no move a question of lighting a candle here or there, but an attempt at total electrification which has begun to glow the light of knowledge of St. Johns Academy.
